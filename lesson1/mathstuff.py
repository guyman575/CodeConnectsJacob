# Make some number variables below
# INTEGERS
a = 5
b = 7
c = 8
# FLOAT
d = 7.7
e = 8.0

# Perform all arithmetic operations using the numbers
a + b
a - b
c / a
a * b
a ** b
a % b
c // a
# Show difference between int and float
a + d # float returned
a + e # still float

# Example of shorthand operator/assignment
# a = a + b
a += b

# Example of multiple assignment
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
